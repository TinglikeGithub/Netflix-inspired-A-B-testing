**About Me**

My name is Ting Pan. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science, complemented by a rich foundation in Economics, Finance, and Law. My keen interest lies in utilizing data science to address tangible real-world challenges.

**Project Description**

Netflix-inspired experiments with multiple design factors aim to minimize user browsing time by examining four primary factors: Tile Size, Match Score, Preview Length, and Preview Type. 

**Outcome**

The location of the minimum browse time when viewing Netflix suggestions was when the preview length = 75, match score = 75, tile size = 0.2, and preview type = TT.
